main.cpp:5: -0style Use either all tabs or all spaces for indentation, don't mix and match

imageanalysis.hpp:4: -1style Unneeded include file(s), <limits>

imageanalysis.hpp:37: -0style It would be better to initialize the pointer value with something at declaration time (e.g., NULL or nullptr)

imageanalysis.hpp:42: -3design Put your method implementations outside the class declaration

imageanalysis.hpp:65: -2design Although it's impressive you managed to avoid using a specialized template constructor, this loop is redundant in the case of an unsigned char

imageanalysis.hpp:87: -1design Instead of a loop, use std::copy() to copy memory

imageanalysis.hpp:103: -0design Again, this loop is unneeded in the case of an unsigned char. Better to use template specialization

imageanalysis.hpp:121: -0style Can do this with a std algorithm for_each or transform

imageio.cpp:89: -1style Remove commented out test / debug code
